Version 3.7.0-DEV
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] Support for periodic boundary conditions in `sasa_particles` with `unitcell` keyword argument.
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `output_dots` option to `sasa_particles` to return the dots of the surface. 
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] return more compact SASA object. Rename `atomic_sasa` to `sasa_particles` (keep alias for compatibility).
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] make the `AtomDots` of sasa calculation a continguous memory block, to reduce GC pressure.
- ![INFO][badge-info] Set default `n_dots` of `atomic_sasa` computations to 512 instead of 500 such that it is a multiple of 16, the default `N_SIMD`.
- ![INFO][badge-info] add doc examples.

Version 3.5.5
-------------
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] use Fibonacci lattice to generate exactly `n_dots` the dots in the sphere. Use default `n_dots=500`.

Version 3.5.4
-------------
- ![INFO][badge-info] Provide a better error message when a field in a CIF file does not fit in the fixed-size string to which it must be assigned.

Version 3.5.3
-------------
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] precompile SASA functions. 

Version 3.5.2
-------------
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] faster SASA calculation.

Version 3.5.1
-------------
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] improve selection syntax for non-contiguous indexing in `sasa`. 

Version 3.5.0
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `atomic_sasa` and `sasa` functions to compute solvent accessible surface area.
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] Add `vdw_radius` as element property, and `element_vdw_radius` function to fetch them.
- ![INFO][badge-info] The element symbol is returned as a `InlineStrings.String3`. 
- ![INFO][badge-info] Masses are returned as `Float32` values instead of `Float64`.

Version 3.4.0
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `Plots.scatter(::Ramachandran)` to plot Ramachandran objects.
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `Ramachandran` method and struct, to compute Ramachandran plots.
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `dihedral` method to compute directly dihedral given four Atom objects.

Version 3.3.0
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `zeta` and `zeta_check` functions to check for Calpha chirality of protein residues. 

Version 3.2.0
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] Selection by coordinate values (e. g. `select(atoms,"x > 0")`) 

Version 3.1.1
-------------
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] better handling of alternate conformations of protein residues. 
- ![INFO][badge-info] Set version to 3.1.1

Version 3.1.0
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] Selection syntax now supports parenthesis and the shortcut for `or`, as in `resname ARG CYS ALA`. 
- ![INFO][badge-info] CYS is now classified as a polar residue, following the definition of VMD.
- ![INFO][badge-info] GLY is now classified as a polar residue, following the definition of VMD.
- ![INFO][badge-info] Set version to 3.1.0

Version 3.0.0
-------------
- ![FEATURE][badge-feature] `write_mmcif` and `write_pdb` support a third positional argument, `String` or `Function`, to write a selection of the atoms.
- ![ENHANCEMENT][badge-enhancement] `select_with_vmd` returns a vector of `Atom`s if the input was a vector of `Atom`s. 
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] `select_with_vmd`  returns a vector of `Atom`s if the input was a vector of `Atom`s. 
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] In all functions that accepted the `only` keyword parameter to define selections with a Julia function, the keyword parameter was dropped and now the function can be provided as a positional second argument, or third argument for `write_pdb` and `write_mmcif` functions.
- ![BREAKING][badge-breaking] `get_seq` functions do not support anymore the input of the file name. An array of `Atom`s must be provided. This is because internally it would be required to recognize PDB of mmCIF functions.
- ![INFO][badge-info] Dropped Julia 1.9 support (minimum requirement is 1.10)
- ![INFO][badge-info] Set version to 3.0.0
